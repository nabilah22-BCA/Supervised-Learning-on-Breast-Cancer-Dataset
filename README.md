Supervised Learning on Breast Cancer Dataset

This repository contains an implementation of supervised learning techniques applied to the Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of various classification algorithms on a real-world dataset.

Features

Dataset: Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

Preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature scaling.

Evaluation: Comparison of model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports.

Files

classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation and analysis.

How to Use

Clone the repository.

Install required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.
